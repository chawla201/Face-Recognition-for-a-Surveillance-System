# Face Recognition for a Surveillance System

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. The project uses LBPH openCV algorithm to identify the basic features of the face and builds a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) for every entry in the database. A HOG for every face in the test/input frame is generated and compared to the HOGs inn database to identify a particular person.
